<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Ruth, a passionate and self-taught web developer,
  who has recently embarked on an exciting journey into the world of coding. 
  Over the past few months, I've immersed myself in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've built a few personal projects
   that showcase my growing skills. While I may not have much professional experience yet, 
   I'm eager to apply what I've learned and gain hands-on experience.
</p>

<p>I'm actively seeking internship or volunteering opportunities where I can contribute, 
  learn, and continue to grow as a developer. 
  I'm a quick learner, highly motivated, and excited about the opportunity to collaborate on real-world 
  projects that make a difference.
</p>

<p>Let’s connect and create something amazing together!.
